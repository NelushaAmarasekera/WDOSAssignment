                <h2>Eco-Friendly Packaging</h2>
                
                <p>Eco-friendly packaging is any packaging that is easy to recycle, secure for 
                    people and the atmosphere and made from recycled materials. It uses fabrics 
                    and processing processes with limited effects on energy use and natural 
                    capital. Eco-friendly packaging options, also known as recycled or green 
                    packaging, strive to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide choices for easy recycling of packaging.</li>
                        <li>Reduce the sum of food packaging. </li>
                        <li>Eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals in the manufacturing of packaging. </li>
                        <li>Promote the use of renewable/reusable materials. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Why we should use Eco-Freindly Packaging</h2>
                    
                    <p>The environmental consequences of single-use plastics do not begin and conclude 
                        with the disposal of waste. It is just the tail end of the whole process that 
                        most customers are conscious of. A certain type of packaging can have a serious 
                        effect on the environment at any point of its life, starting with the procurement 
                        of raw materials, production, transport, intention and all the way to its disposal.</p>

                    <p><u>The Sustainable Packaging Alliance discusses that this innovative packaging 
                        approach is beneficial to our world as a whole.</u></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is made of products that are safe </li>
                        <li>It's safe and sustainable for individuals and families during their life cycle. </li>
                        <li>It is sourced, generated, transported and recycled using renewable energy.</li>
                        <li>Optimizes the use of recycled or sustainable source materials. </li>
                        <li>Eco-packaging materials are produced using clean manufacturing processes and ethical standards. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What are the best packaging materials for the environment?</h2>
                    
                    <p>There are also natural options for packaging that are biodegradable and recyclable.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Corn starch – The wrapping of 'peanuts' (protective packaging used to keep 
                        delicate products in place) may be made from corn or plant starch material. 
                        This type of packaging can be used instead of plastic bubble wrap. 
                        Starch-made peanut packaging is completely biodegradable.</li>
                    <li>Paper – This is a perfect packaging choice since it is reusable, recyclable, 
                        biodegradable and can be used for any reason. Some of the paper 
                        packaging we see every day is made of recycled paper.</li>
                    <li>Cardboard – Cardboard is another perfect packing choice owing to its durable design. 
                        Cardboard that isn't laminated quickly decomposes.</li>
                    <li>Bagasse Paper – This packing material is made from extracted sugar cane fiber pulp juice. 
                        Bagasse paper is widely used as a replacement for conventional paper wrapping in food services.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Ways of Eco Packaging</h2>
                    <p>There are more ways you can explore as you shift to green packaging. Here are eco-friendly 
                        packaging ideas you might want to consider.</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Eco-pouch packaging</b>This simple and customizable eco-pouch is made from 
                                recycled pulp starch. The great thing about this packaging approach is that 
                                it can be turned into a compostable substance within 85 days.</li>
                            <li><b>Canvas tote bags</b>It’s a woven fabric made from jute plant skin and 
                                vegetable fibres. Sturdy and durable, Hessian bags can be used to contain 
                                bulky items. It’s an ideal grocery bag as well.</li>
                            <li><b>Eco-box packaging</b>If you use cardboard boxes for all your packaging 
                                needs, you’re already doing a monumental effort in reducing wastes through 
                                your business. Just make sure to use boxes that are a hundred per cent 
                                made from recycled materials. </li>
                            <li><b>Eco-friendly labels</b>Wherever you attach it (on boxes, pouches, 
                                bottles, etc.), your product seal or label has to be biodegradable, 
                                recyclable, and/or compostable.</li>
                        </ul>
