        <p id="para1">Eco-friendly goods are products which do not affect the environment, whether they are made, used or disposed of.
            Eco Life is designed to aware the society mainly about the Eco-friendly products of Sri lanka,
            Manufacturers of eco products in Sri lanka, the types of products we produce in here and their benefits.
            We seek to raise awareness of the effect of single-use plastics on our health and communities and
            to tell the world to join with us for a green future.

            <h2>What is an Eco-Friendly Product?</h2>
            <img id="box1Img" src="pictures/m2.jpg" alt="box1image">
            <p id="para2">This word clearly defines a product which is not environmentally damaging. 
            It can be more complex than that, though, because there are many reasons 
            that may be "harmful to the environment." So many different items can have
             a detrimental effect on the environment, such as not using appropriate 
            protocols when goods are disposed of. There are, however, many advantages of
             using eco-friendly goods that are not only based on the Earth's health and 
            well-being, but rather on the health of the Earth.(Kangovou, 2017)</p>

                <h2>Benefits of Eco-Friendly Products</h2>
                <img id="box2Img" src="pictures/m5.jpg" alt="box2image">
                <p>Often, because of the cost, customers don't buy eco-friendly goods. They may
                    seem more costly, but several of these things last longer and offer many 
                   advantages over other products, such as:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Lower Costs.</li>
                       <li>Recycled</li>
                       <li>Sustainable to the world</li>
                       <li>Healthier Living</li>
                       <li>Cost savings on energy bills.</li>
                       <li>Lower Maintenance</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>The opportunity to save the world is, of course, the main advantage. You can move
                    forward with trust with the right eco-friendly goods, believing you are not
                    causing any damage to the environment.(Chicago Greenbox, 2020)</p>

                <h2>How to tell if a product is Eco-friendly?</h2>
                <img id="box3Img" src="pictures/cup.jpg" alt="box2image">
                <p>While many businesses and their goods claim to be environmentally conscious,
                    their information can be misconstrued, leaving customers confused and
                    sometimes blindly purchasing their products. When shopping for
                    environmentally friendly items, look for:</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Energy Star – for appliances and electronics that are energy saving</li>
                        <li>USDA Organic Seal – for cosmetics and foods that truly are organic</li>
                        <li>Green Seal – for cleaning products that are safe for the environment</li>
                        <li>Forest Stewardship Council Logo – for paper and wood products</li>
                    </ol>
