                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>"In 1993 a brief encounter with a piece of ‘recycled paper’ led us on a journey that 
                        would give rise to what was at that time a whole new industry in the country. The
                         paper originated in a factory in Pannala, one of only two in the country that was
                         making recycled paper. A whole new team and added new products and processes
                         to the production cycle – creating paper using waste from paddy, banana and
                         pineapple cultivations as well as waste paper and elephant dung. Bringing this new
                         product to the Colombo market, we knocked on the doors of leading businesses
                         educating them about the product and the need to support recycling."</p>
                    <h3>Today</h3>
                    <p>"We source a range of embellishments and outsource a variety of handcrafted work
                        to small suppliers with final assembly, customization and most importantly
                        quality control being carried out at our factory and workshop in Colombo.
                       In many ways, this evolution of our business model has enabled us to have a
                        greater impact on the livelihoods of Sri Lankan artisans and the communities
                        in which they operate."(Trickledown, 2017)</p>
